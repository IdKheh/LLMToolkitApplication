            "but through experiences like climbing trees, riding bikes, or asking countless questions about the "
            "world. Childhood is also when we start to form our first dreams, with imaginations running wild, "
            "envisioning all that we might one day become. The innocence of childhood allows us to see the world "
            "through a lens of possibility, before the weight of responsibilities and challenges of adulthood set "
            "in. These early years shape who we are, laying the foundation for the adults we’ll eventually grow "
            "into."'''
